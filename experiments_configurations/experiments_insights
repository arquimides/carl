- The causal discovery process is affected in large extend when we use the SAME episode initialization
strategy. However, the CRL agent still perform better in terms that police learn. That should be because
we are using only the reward part of the causal relations for now. TO Test this just run the same experiment
changing the EpisodeStateInitialization from RANDOM to SAME

- It is better to do RLforCD than not do it, even using the very simple strategy.
